Scope 
We can begin the shaping of the designed system when considering the requirments needed for the work breakdown structure (WBS), 

3.1 Staff of e-catering 
User = employee.
Manager = handles supplier and customer details.
Beverage Supplier = supplies beverages.
Food Supplier = supplies food.
Delivery = delivers food and handles rest of the money.
These members will be of utomost importance for the completion of the e-catering system. The employee/user of the system will the main 
role in the system. They will take in the orders given by the customers. The management/ manager will have the role of handling suppliers 
and other main needed managementarial roles. Since the system has to have the option of the downpayment, the employee will have to deal with the payment as
well as the final person making the delivery to the customer. The remaining payment will be made to the person who makes the delivery. Therefore the 
employee and delivery person has to interact and make sure the payments are upto pare. 

3.2 Customers 
In the e-catering system, the customer has the ability to search for food and beverages in the menu from published e-catalogs. 
The customer can change the menu according to their liking. The person ordering the food can compose a meal according to their liking, alterning the available
menu and making a package for their liking. The person ordering the food has to make a downpayment as soon as the meal is ordered to secure the order, 
the rest of the payment is to be made once the delivery is done. This ensures that no fraud food orders will be placed.
